## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security issue in Gaugid SDK (e.g. authentication bypass, token leakage, or a dependency vulnerability that affects this project):

1. **Report privately** by opening a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/alpibrusl/gaugid-sdk/security/advisories/new) (preferred), or by emailing the maintainers if you need a non-GitHub channel.
2. **Include** a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact. If you have a fix or mitigation, mention it.
3. **Allow time** for a response (we aim to acknowledge within 5 business days and to provide an initial assessment shortly after).
4. **Coordinate disclosure** — we will work with you on a fix and a public disclosure timeline. We credit reporters in advisories unless they prefer to stay anonymous.

We do not consider theoretical issues without a practical impact, or issues in third-party services (e.g. Gaugid API) that are not under this repository’s control. For those, please contact the respective service provider.

Thank you for helping keep Gaugid SDK and its users safe.
