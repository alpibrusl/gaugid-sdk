# Governance

How the Gaugid SDK project is maintained and how decisions are made.

## Maintainers

The project is maintained by the **Gaugid team**. Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Releasing versions and publishing packages
- Triaging issues and discussions
- Updating documentation and policies

Current maintainers are listed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alpibrusl/gaugid-sdk) (organization members or contributors with write access).

## Decision making

- **Code and API** — Maintainers decide on code structure, API design, and breaking changes. Significant changes are discussed in issues or discussions and documented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Dependencies and tooling** — Maintainers choose dependencies, CI, and tooling with a focus on stability and maintainability.
- **Community** — We follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org). Enforcement decisions are made by maintainers.

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute via pull requests and discussions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Maintainers will review and merge contributions that align with project goals and quality standards.

## Versioning and releases

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Release process and version locations are documented in [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md). Only maintainers publish releases to PyPI and npm.
